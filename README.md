# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
Final Project for Data Structures. Utilized a red black tree and the Twitter API to do an analysis of tweets
based on keywords that were each given a particular negative or positive value. Calculated values of 
individual tweets to determine Twitter users' feelings towards certain food groups.
